                        Chess notation has a simple formula to follow, and is important when translating moves. The formula is the 
                        piece followed by the square coordinate it goes to. The Coordinates go from A-H (The Files/Rows) and from 
                        1-8 (The Ranks/Columns). a1 is White's dark square corner and h8 is White's dark square corner.
                        <br>
                        Each piece is represented by a single letter:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="fs-5">
                        <li>King: K</li>
                        <li>Knight: N</li>
                        <li>Queen: Q</li>
                        <li>Bishop: B</li>
                        <li>Rook: R</li>
                    </ul> 
                    <p class="fs-5">
                        If two pieces of the same type and color can move onto the same square, we also need to specify which piece. 
                        This is done by using the file or rank the moving piece is on. We can also indicate captures using 'x'.
                        We can also denote a check with '+' and checkmate with '#' at the end of the move. 
                        Finally, Castling is represented with O-O 
                        (Kingside/Short) and O-O-O (Queenside/Long). "1. e4 e5" Means that on the first move, White moved a pawn to 
                        e4 and Black moved a pawn to e5. "2. Nf3 Nc6" means that White moved a knight to f3 and Black moved a knight 
                        to c6. "Ncxd5" means that a knight on the c file captured a pawn or piece on d5.

                        The King is the most important piece in the game and can not be captured. "Check" refers to a state where the 
                        the King is being attacked. "Checkmate" refers to a state where the King can not get out of Check. Checks can 
                        be handled by moving the king, capturing the attacking piece, or blocking the check. Because Kings can not 
                        be captured, a King can not move into a Check because they would be captured on the next move.

                        There are a multitude of ways to draw the game. One of which is called Stalemate. A Stalemate happens when one 
                        side can not make a move that doesn't result in a Check, thus can not make a move, resulting in a draw.
                        There is also the draw by repition. This happens when the same position and same side to move is reached
                        3 times over the course of the game. There is also the 50 move rule. If a pawn move or pice/pawn capture 
                        has not happened in the last 50 moves, the game ends in a draw. The game can also end in a draw if both sides
                        lack sufficient material to force a checkmate. Finally, players can agree to a draw.

                        Castling is represented by the notations O-O and O-O-O. Castling happens by moving the King two squares towards
                        the rook, and then moving the rook adjacent to the king and on the other side of the king. You can not castle
                        with a rook if the rook or king has moved. Also, you can not castle through check or while in check.

                        En Passant means "In Passing". In chess, if a pawn moves forward 2 squares, but could have been captured by 
                        another pawn if it only moved forward 1 sqaure, it can still be captured by the enemy pawn for 1 move only.
